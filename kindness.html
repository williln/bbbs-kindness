                            <p>First, we helped Sheilisa's mom around the house by taking out the trash without being asked!</p>

                            <p>Sheilisa left a note with lots of amazing and inspiration messages on someone's car as we left the park. She wrote things like, "You're amazing!" and "Be confident!" We're sure it brightened up someone's day!</p>

                            <p>Before we left the park, we spent a few minutes picking up as much trash as we could find. We felt better leaving the park cleaner than we found it.</p>

                            <p>We went through Dutch Bros. and paid for a man on a motorcycle behind us! You can't see him in the photo very well, but trust us, he was there and very grateful for a cool drink on a warm day!</p>

                            <p>We both love basil, so we went to the garden section of the store and got matching basil plants and pots. We planted the basil in our pots (basil is great for container gardening!), and now Sheilisa and her mom, and Lacey and her husband, will have fresh basil for pizza, pasta and salad all summer! </p>

                            <p>Lacey gave a talk for Refresh Portland on having an English background and being a software developer. The talk was free and open to the public, and she got to share her experience with other people!</p>

                            <p>Sheilisa is such a great student and a role model to her class that she was honored at her school's Academic Progress ceremony! This wasn't on the list, but it's the culmination of a school year's worth of hard work on her part. She does kind things for others all year round.</p>
